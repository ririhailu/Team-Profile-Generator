![screenshot](./assets/Screenshot2.png)




## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to create a team generator application including manager, engineer, and intern. For each position, the name, id, and email were included. The application will ask the user about the employee and team member information. Once all the input has been placed and the team is formed, the application will create an HTML file to display team members and their information.


## Installation

The Team-Profile-Generator was first created in repository in GitHub. The repository was cloned into local desktop. Any changes made to local was added, committed, and pushed to repository. This application uses Node, NPM, Inquirer and Jest.
